Welcome to my personal website. I am an AI researcher currently pursuing my PhD in Probabilistic Machine Learning and Robotics under [Prof Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/21_65.php) at the [ALR Lab](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/index.php), Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology. Before that I was a Data Scientist at the cybersecurity firm McAfee (Intel Security). Previously I worked with Intel for 2 years. I hold a post graduate degree in [Machine Learning and Computing](https://www.iist.ac.in/departments/mathematics-academics) from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).

My [doctoral thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16078) focussed on building "World models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions" based on probabilistic and Bayesian principles. In general I am interested in understanding human intelligence. My current research attempts are at developing algorithms/agents inspired by human brain that can learn continually in a non-stationary environment and can solve long horizon tasks. I use neural network architectures that are backed by probalisitic principles to build these models. 

**ðŸŒˆDiversity and Inclusion Statement:** I care deeply about making work places more diverse and the inclusion of women, LGBTQ+ and under-represented minorities in AI research. I believe innovation/creativity thrives under diversity in perspectives and life experiences.
