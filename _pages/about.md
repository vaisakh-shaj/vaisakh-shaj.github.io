Welcome to my personal website. I am a researcher interested in the advancing algorithms to make artificial agents more intelligent. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Robot Learning under [Prof Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/21_65.php) at the [ALR Lab](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/index.php), Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology. Before that I was a Data Scientist at the cybersecurity firm McAfee (Intel Security). Previously I worked with Intel for 2 years. I hold a post graduate degree in [Machine Learning and Computing](https://www.iist.ac.in/departments/mathematics-academics) from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).

At present for my PhD, I focus on building probablisitc recurrent state space models and learning world models with it. In general I am interested in developing algorithms that can learn continually in a non-stationary environment and can solve long horizon tasks. I use neural network architectures that are backed by probalisitic principles to build these models.
